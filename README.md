# FacialEmotionRecognitionCNN
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is particularly well-suited for processing and recognizing patterns in two-dimensional data, such as images. CNNs have proven to be highly effective in various computer vision tasks, including facial emotional recognition.

In this case with the help of a CNN we are training a model with 70% of accuracy in order to get very aceptable results.
